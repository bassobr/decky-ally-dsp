# Changelog

## 0.1.9 (2026-10-03)

- Support the ROG Ally X (2024, RC72LA, codec subsystem 1043:1EB3) with its own
  ASUS package (Dolby Atmos driver V9.816.706.24) (#7 by @gmartsenkov).
- Per-device package registry in `defaults/fallback-sources.json`: display name,
  ASUS API query and pinned fallback package per lowercase codec subsystem id.
- Compare codec subsystem ids in lowercase everywhere.
- If the newest package from the ASUS API has no tuning for the codec, setup
  downloads the pinned package and tries again.
- "Try anyway" on an unknown device tries every pinned package.
- Generic device names in the unit description and the plugin metadata.

## 0.1.8 (2026-10-03)

- The backend shuts down cleanly when Decky stops it. With Decky v3.2.9 the
  plugin's socket loop spins once Decky closes its end of the connection, so
  the backend was killed after 5 s and `_uninstall` often never ran, which left
  the unit and runtime data behind after an uninstall. The backend now makes
  that read wait, and its unload and uninstall hooks no longer await anything.

## 0.1.7 (2026-10-03)

- Running setup no longer switches the DSP on: it starts the chain only when
  the DSP is switched on and no headphones are in use, and autostart follows
  the switch.
- Switching the DSP on or changing presets while headphones are in use no
  longer starts the chain; it starts once the headphones are unplugged.
- install.sh stops ally-dsp.service while it replaces the plugin and starts it
  again afterwards (#8 by @gmartsenkov).
- Update rollup to 4.63.4 (Dependabot).

## 0.1.6 (2026-10-03)

- No Steam restart after an in-app update: Decky already loads the new UI, and
  the panel now switches to it by itself (otherwise it asks to press B and
  reopen Ally DSP). The "Restart Steam after updates" toggle is gone. Updating
  from 0.1.4 with that toggle on still restarts Steam once, because 0.1.4's
  code handles that update.
- Uninstall cleanup no longer relies on a 15-minute update marker: the unit and
  runtime data are removed a minute after Decky's `_uninstall` only if the
  plugin is really gone. Fixes data loss when Decky's update prompt was
  confirmed after more than 15 minutes or two prompts were confirmed in a row.
- Saving a setting while setup runs no longer overwrites the finished setup.
- Update checks no longer block the backend: the panel shows the cached result
  and a due check runs in the background; after a failed check the next try
  waits 30 minutes instead of running on every refresh.
- Extras and pre-gain are locked while setup runs; changes that still arrive
  are applied when it finishes, as is the running game's own preset. A
  reconversion repeats until the presets match the current extras.

## 0.1.4 (2026-09-20)

- Restart Steam automatically after an in-app update so the new UI loads
  (Maintenance toggle, default on); manual restart button when the UI is stale.

## 0.1.3 (2026-09-19)

- Update @types/react and @types/react-dom to 19.3.0 (Dependabot).

## 0.1.2 (2026-09-19)

- Keep unit and runtime data when Decky replaces the plugin during an update
  (Decky calls `_uninstall` in that path); real uninstalls still clean up.
- Restore the active preset and unit on startup; re-run setup if data is missing.
- Show a hint when Steam still runs an older cached UI bundle.

## 0.1.1 (2026-09-19)

- Remove the Custom 1–3 presets (Dolby's neutral personalize profiles).
- English-only UI.
- Await background tasks on unload.

## 0.1.0 (2026-09-19)

First release.

- Setup wizard: hardware check, ASUS "Dolby Atmos driver" download with SHA-256
  verification, DAX3 tuning extraction, converter venv, conversion of all
  profiles, activation.
- PipeWire filter chain (convolver, LSP parametric EQ, multiband compressor,
  autogain, limiter) as WirePlumber smart filter in a systemd user unit.
- Presets Game/Dynamic/Movie/Music/Voice × Balanced/Detailed/Warm, global or
  per game; headphone pause; extras (leveler, dialog, regulator, pre-gain).
- Diagnostics page and text report.
- Signed self-update from GitHub Releases, installed via Decky Loader.
